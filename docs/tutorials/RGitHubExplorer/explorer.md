# ($NAME)
Welcome to our second introductory tutorial to the Reactant architecture.

In this tutorial we'll create an explorer that will find some random GitHub users (sorted by most followers). If you tap on any of them, their repositories are shown along with number of stars in each one.

The whole project can be found on GitHub [here][reactant-explorer].

##### Let's get started.

### Part 1: Setting Up a Project
There are many ways to go about creating a new Reactant project. Creating it by hand can be overwhelming at first, so we're using  to build it for us this time.

Let's create a project using [**Reactant CLI**][reactant-CLI] with `reactant init`.

Click the **RUN** button (![-RUN BUTTON-](../RunButton.png)) to check that everything is running smooth. If it doesn't, consider visiting the [Troubleshooting Tips][troubleshooting] section.

TODO add `Fetcher` to Podfile so we can

### Part 2: Preparing the Insides
#### Model
We will need a `User` and `Repository` models. As we'll be only tracking user's followers and number of repositories, this `User.swift` is enough:
```swift
struct User: Codable {

}
```

And `Repository.swift` could look like this:
```swift
struct Repository: Codable {

}
```
