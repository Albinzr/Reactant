     * Array of observables through which the Component communicates with outside world.
     * - ATTENTION: Each of the `Observable`s need to be *rewritten* or *mapped* to be of the correct type - the ACTION.
     * - `ObservableConvertibleType.rewrite` is used on the Observable if it's `Void` and `ObservableConvertibleType.map` if it carries a value
     * - a good idea is to create an `enum`, cases without value should be used with method
     *  `ObservableConvertibleType.rewrite` and cases with should be used with method `ObservableConvertibleType.map`
     * ## Example
     * ```
     * button.rx.tap.rewrite(with: MyRootViewAction.loginTapped)
     *
     * textField.rx.text.skip(1).map(MyRootViewAction.emailChanged)
     * ```
     *
     * For more info, see [Component Action](https://docs.reactant.tech/getting-started/quickstart.html#component-action)
     * - WARNING: When listening to Component's actions, subscribe to `Component.action` instead of this variable.
     *  `Component.action` includes `Component.perform(action:)` calls as well as `Observable`s defined in `actions`.

     * ## Example
     * You decide to change the amount of active buttons based on device orientation. `actions` don't automatically change
     * based on the conditions that are in the computed variable, because this would be ineffective.
     * This is where you call `resetActions()` when orientation changes causing `actions` to update and the amount of active buttons is changed as well.
