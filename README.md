# Reactant

Reactant is a foundation for rapid and safe iOS development. It allows you to cut down your development costs by improving reusability, testability and safety of your code, especially your UI. Check our our [quick-start guide][quick-start] to learn more.

## Requirements

* iOS 9.0+
* Xcode 8.0+
* Swift 3.0+

**NOTE**: We have experimental support for *macOS* platform in `macOS` branch, but it's incomplete and definitely not recommended for production. Our plan is to add full `macOS` support in near future.

## Get Started
Head to our [quick-start guide][quick-start] to learn how Reactant works and what it can do to decrease your development costs!

## Versioning
This library uses semantic versioning. We won't introduce any breaking changes without releasing a new major version. Our main goal is to keep the API as stable as possible. We build our applications on top of Reactant as well and we absolutely hate any breaking changes.
